# Database-Project-2
This project is to use Oracle's PL/SQL and JDBC to implement the RBMS application. Up to three students may work together as a group for this project. A team may consist of students from all database sections. Due to time constraint, only a subset of the database tables and a subset of the desired functionalities will be implemented in this project.
